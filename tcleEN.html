Dear Sir or Madam:<br>
  <br>
We would like to invite you to participate in a research on Experimental Behavior Analysis. The purpose is to study some variables that can affect the way people behave in certain situations. Your participation is very important and it would take place as follows: you will participate in a maximum of, [<b>XX</b>] experimental sessions <i>online</i>. The sessions will be held individually and will last approximately 20 minutes each. You must be in a comfortable place and perform the task without interruption. The session will be filmed. Generally speaking, the objective will be to earn as many points as possible (which will appear on the computer screen). <br>
  <br>
We clarify that your participation is completely voluntary, and you can: refuse to participate, or even give up at any time, without this causing any burden or loss to you. We also clarify that your information will be used only for the purposes of this research and will be treated with the utmost secrecy and confidentiality, in order to preserve your identity. The videos of the sessions will be destroyed shortly after the results are published.<br> 
The expected benefits are to increase our knowledge about variables that affect human behavior. As for the risks, we suggest that if you have a diagnosis or suspect of repetitive strain injury to your hands and arms, do not participate in the research due to the use of the computer. <br>
If you have any questions or need further clarification, you can contact us,[<b> NAME OF RESPONSIBLE RESEARCHER, DEPARTMENT, UNIVERSITY, PHONE, E-MAIL </b>], or contact the Research Ethics Committee of [<b> University where the project was approved, address and telephone </b>].
